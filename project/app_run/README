These scripts provide convenient one-line methods to execute programs.

On the command-line, if you are in the same directory as the scripts themselves then you are in the wrong directory.

Go up one level (e.g.  cd ..)

You should then be directly under the projects directory. This would allo you to run any of these scripts by refering to ./app_run/

For example, to run the newsreader UI, you would execute: ./app_run/newsreader.sh
