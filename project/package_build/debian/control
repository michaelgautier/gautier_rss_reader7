Description: Shows Internet feeds in a clean and obvious way. Comes with a screen that helps
 you add new feeds or purge those you no longer need. 
 The program uses a native code UI that runs smooth with no bloat.
 NOTE:
 - Feed providers prefer their site is accessed no earlier than once per hour.
 - The program respects those conditions by default.
 - This version 7 has no public predecessors with an installation package.
 - Previous versions existed on the Internet in source code form.
 - Earlier versions exist that were not packaged for installation.
 - Version 7 is the first Gautier RSS program packaged for installation.
